### All The StarWars Data! 

Using the StarWars API (SWAPI) and the Charts.JS API I was able to create a seamless react experience, that is designed to display all the content/information in a user-friendly manner!

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the process I used to create the final website. I started by looking at multiple examples of what I wanted to create or how I wanted to design the website.  After creating wireframes I got an idea of how I wanted to design the website.  I then went on to implement the functionality of the website, and style the website.

### Wireframes

### Final UI

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Utilized React `Charts.JS` dependency for Data visualization
* Implemented Routing with `React-Router v6`.
* Implemented `React Bootstrap`
* SWAPI End Point: https://swapi.dev/api/
* OMDB API End Point: https://www.omdbapi.com/?t=A+New+Hope&apikey=5d0c0e4f


#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* This was a fun and interesting process, although it was a ver intense project to learn and implement react within the given time period. I do believe it was worth it and a very good experience. 

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* The main challenge was the StarWars API.  
* At first glance, the API appears to have all the necessary information, but after implementing the API I realized that it does not have all the features, that I would have wanted.  


#### Above And Beyond

Aditionaly featurs that I implementd into the brief.
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* I added an additional API to pull information for the website.
* I added a feature, that filters through the API tree to act as a counter for some additional information.

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* For future improvements, I would like to focus more on the visual design. 
* Additionally I would want to implement more APIs that  will pull relevant content for the StarWars Website

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
